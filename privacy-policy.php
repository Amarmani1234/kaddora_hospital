                We use cookies and similar technologies to operate the website and improve the user experience.
                Cookies can be <em>essential</em> (required for site operation), <em>performance</em> (analytics),
                or <em>functional</em> (remember settings). You can control cookies through your browser settings,

            <p>
                We use third-party services (such as analytics providers and payment processors). These third parties
                have their own privacy policies and may collect data in accordance with their terms.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-4">7. Security</h4>
            <p>
                We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your

            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-4">8. Data Retention</h4>
            <p>
                We retain personal information only as long as necessary to provide services, comply with legal obligations,
                resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Retention periods vary depending on the nature of the data.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-4">9. Your Rights</h4>
            <p>

            </p>
